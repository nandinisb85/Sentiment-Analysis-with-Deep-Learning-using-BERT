# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Sentiment Analysis** using the **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model. The goal is to classify text data based on sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing text data for BERT input, including tokenization and encoding.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
- **Tools**: Leveraged Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the script to fine-tune the model and evaluate results.
